# AMAclient
client for mmorpg

My initial goal was to send Tibia to hell with this, so this is where I was going initially.
Very few things beyond core functionality are finished or even implemented at all.
No economy, character development still in diapers, no death toll mechanic discussed etc.

Server is on the other repository.

Things to do to build it:
-run server
-run client on any http server
-run mongoDB
-check network_settings.js files on both server and client.
-let me know how that worked out!
